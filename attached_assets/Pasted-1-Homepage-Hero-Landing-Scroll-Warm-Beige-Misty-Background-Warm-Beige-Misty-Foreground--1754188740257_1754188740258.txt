+++++++++++++++++++++++



 Referring to the homepage style of Jaree Basgall where the image looks “pasted” on top of a soft misty/nature background. That layered look feels warm and offline-clinic-like.

🎨 (Wellness Whispers)

Here’s how you can adapt this aesthetic:



1. Color Scheme (Pastel & Nature-based)

Base Backgrounds:
Misty beige 🌫️
Soft sage green 🌱
Warm sand / light taupe 🌾
Accent Colors:
Peachy blush 🌸 (matches your gentle tone)
Warm terracotta 🧡 (contrast but still earthy)
Soft olive green 🌿 (matches nature theme)
Text Colors:
Deep earthy brown for headings
Charcoal grey for body text
Occasional sage green highlight


2. Image Style

Use “pasted” effect images (like a Polaroid taped on) → creates intimacy.
Background = misty texture (paper, linen, blurred nature).
Foreground = warm therapist or therapy moment photo.


3. Alternate Page Feel

Homepage: Misty pastel background + pasted photo → clinic-like welcome.
Session/Approach Page: Nature leaves or dried flowers in background → grounding.
Testimonials: Soft beige with Polaroid-style client notes → authentic.


4. Matching with Your Therapy Posts

Keep nature overlays consistent (leaves, light shadows, dried flowers).
Alternate between warm indoor (lamp, desk) + nature calm (misty greens) backgrounds.
