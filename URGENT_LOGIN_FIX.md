# URGENT: Admin Login Fix for Netlify

## Problem
The admin login at https://wellnesswhispers.in/admin/login is failing because:
1. Frontend sends POST to `/api/auth/login`
2. Netlify redirects `/api/*` to `/.netlify/functions/server/*`
3. Function receives path as `/auth/login` (not `/api/auth/login`)

## Solution Implemented
Added dual route handling in `netlify/functions/server.js`:

```javascript
// Handle both paths - Netlify function receives /auth/login
app.post('/auth/login', async (req, res) => { /* login logic */ });
app.post('/api/auth/login', async (req, res) => { /* existing logic */ });
```

## Testing the Fix
```bash
# This should work now:
curl -X POST "https://wellnesswhispers.in/.netlify/functions/server/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@wellnesswhispers.in","password":"admin123"}'
```

## Expected Result
After the next GitHub push to trigger Netlify deployment:
- ✅ Admin login will work at https://wellnesswhispers.in/admin/login
- ✅ API endpoints will respond correctly
- ✅ Admin panel will be fully functional

## Status
**READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** - Push changes to GitHub to activate the fix.
